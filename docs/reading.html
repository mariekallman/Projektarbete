                     <h2>När isen brister - Ebbe Lieberath</h2>
                     <p>
                        “När isen brister” is a handbook which covers basic facts and tips on how to behave in and around icy areas.
                        The book was written by the author Ebbe Lieberath in 1931 and contains both text, pictures and illustrations 
                        and is 86 pages long. The book is released from copyright and has not in our knowledge been digitised yet. 
                        According to the Libris database, there are only five copies of the book available for lending in libraries 
                        in Sweden (Libris, n.d.). 
                     </p>

                        Ebbe Lieberath was borned in 1871 and is a pioneer in the scout world. 
                        He was the first person to translate Scouting for Boys by Robert Baden-Powell into Swedish. 
                        He also formed the first organised scout association in Sweden, Riddarpojkarna in Gothenburg. 
                        He is also the creator of the magazine “Var Redo” as a joint body for the Swedish scout movement 
                        (Riksarkivet, n.d.). The scout movement in Sweden is still very strong today with 75 000 members 
                        (Scouterna, n.d.) and we believe that Lieberath's work is important to preserve from a Swedish 
                        cultural heritage perspective.
