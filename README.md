## The project

This project work was committed by Elin Fellman and Marie Källman. 

The aim of this project is to digitise the work När isen brister by Ebbe Lieberath. The purpose is not to digitise a specific edition or notes, but rather to digitise the creation and to make it more accessible and preserve it for long-term preservation.

How were accidents related to ice safety viewed in the past and have the accidents decreased with the rise of modern society or have there been more accidents as we are not as used to being out in nature anymore? Preserving När isen brister by Ebbe Lieberath helps to create a historical context and to be able to understand how they before our time acted and behaved. As Smith (2004) describes it:

“A complete and reliable record of the past is important for many reasons, not the least of which is to provide an audit trail of the actions, thoughts, deeds, and misdeeds of those who have gone before us.” 

## About the Developer
This repository was created by using a template developed by [Wout Dillen](https://github.com/WoutDLN). 

The template that was used was specifically designed to help students of the Digitising Cultural Heritage Materials (DCHM) course at the University of Borås publish their digitisation projects online with GitHub Pages.
